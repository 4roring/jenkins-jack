## Creating an Issue

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/tabeyti/jenkins-jack/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.

Be sure to scan through the [most popular](https://github.com/tabeyti/jenkins-jack/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc) feature requests.

If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

* 👍 - upvote
* 👎 - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing a Good Bug Report and Feature Request

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely I'll be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

* Your operating system

* Version of VS Code

* Version of Jenkins Jack

* Version of Jenkins that you're connecting to

* Reproducible steps (1... 2... 3...) that cause the issue

* What you expected to see, versus what you actually saw

* Any errors or relevant output from:

  * The Dev Tools Console (open from the menu: Help > Toggle Developer Tools)

  * The **Jenkins Jack Log** output channel (from the OUTPUT panel, select **Jenkins Jack Log** from the panel drop-down)
